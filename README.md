### My name is Jason [`codeslinger-dev`] and I write (and write about) code and the software development process.

### I am US-based, hold an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, and have made software development my career for the past 20+ years.  My primary language of choice is `C` (usually `C99`) for use in real-time, embedded applications. I also have extensive experience with C++, Make, Bash, Gitlab, Linux/Windows, as well as many other languages, tool, and environments.  I am currently learning Python, Rust and Zig.

### My non-professional software focus is on small, performant, cross-platform libraries and utilities.
